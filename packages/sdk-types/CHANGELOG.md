- [#1930](https://github.com/commercetools/nodejs/pull/1930) [`5a56792`](https://github.com/commercetools/nodejs/commit/5a5679256a4a7e4b90bc47b945b12acb4f70b411) Thanks [@tdeekens](https://github.com/tdeekens)! - # Requires Node.js v18 or later

  This releases migrates packages to require Node.js v18 or later. Ideally you should be already using Node.js v20 or later. According to [Node.js Releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) Node.js v18 will be in maintenance and reach End of Life by the end of April.

  Other than requiring Node.js v18 packages with this releases do not contain any internal breaking changes.
